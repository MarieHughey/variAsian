I am an executive board member on the dance team VariAsian. Our team is relatively new; this is only our second 
year of existing, and as such, there is always a lot to learn and change. At one of our recent board meetings,
we discussed many things we would like to implement next semester to fix a lot of the problems that we've 
faced this semester. For that reason, my goal with this project is to create a central member website where
we can have all of the things we need at our fingertips.

It would include features such as:
(Not necessarily exactly these will be implemented but this is the general idea/goal)

- Access to the website permitted only to current members of VariAsian
        (Bonus Features possibly now, possibly for future)
        * Past members retain some access but not full
        * Past board members retain full access
        * Non-members get a public version of the webpage with less features

- View current schedule
        (Bonus Features possibly now, possibly for future)
        * Current members can see full practice and performance schedule
        * Non-members can see performance and teaching day schedule
        * Board members can adjust the schedule

- View casting results
        * Sort by performance, sort by piece, sort training team and performance team
        (Bonus Features possibly now, possibly for future)
        * Get notifications of your own casting results
        * Get notifications when casting results are released
        * Board members can post casting results
        * Current members can view
        * Non-members can't see

- See Team Roster
        * Sort by name, number of semesters??, performance/training, etc.
        (Bonus Features possibly now, possibly for future)
        * Current and past members can view full roster plus email addresses (&phone numbers??)
        * Board members can see all contact info
